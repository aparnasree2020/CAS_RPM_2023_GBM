Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody with a google account to write and execute arbitrary python/R code through the browser.

# Instructions to run Colab for CAS RPM 2023 GBM session

1. Open your default browser and login to your google account. 
2.	Google Chrome is the browser of choice for this session since it plays well with Google Colab. 
3.	In the same browser, open the following link. 

https://github.com/aparnasree2020/sampledata_casws/blob/main/Run_Models_compare_code.ipynb 

The screen should look like this. 

![Go to Colab link](/readme_images/open_colab.jpg )

4. Click on “Open in Colab” ( marked in yellow)
      -> This opens the colab google session which is were we will be running the R notebook. 
5. You should now be able to see a google colab preview

6. If you are opening the google colab for the first time, you can run the code by going to Runtime and click on Runall

7. Each cell is supposed to be run sequentially, but you can run them out of order too during testing. 
When you hover over a cell, you can see that a "Play" button show up. Click on that play button to run that particular cell

## Challenge/Questions to the participants
* What metric will you choose to evaluate a classification model ? 
* How will you define the "best" model ? 
* Can you find the best hyperparameter for creating the best model ?
